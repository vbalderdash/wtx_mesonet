The Python scripts are for ingesting converted West Texas Mesonet data into useable DataFram objects and for investigating
the data either through individual station meteorgrams or through basic surface
plotting.

Note that the surface plotting functions are still in a form using basemap v1.0.7, so they will either 
need to be customized 
for more current packages or the basemap __init__ may be editted for Python 3 compatability.

## West Texas Mesonet
Current West Texas Mesonet data and more information can be found at 
www.mesonet.ttu.edu

## Testing Notebook
The function_tests notebook contains many of the functions in other scripts for
dependency testing which can be utilized for python notebook functionality.

## Data
The mesonet_sftp.py script can be used to get the raw data for a month from the 
West Texas Mesonet site after entering your username and password into the script
along with the month of interest. 

## Meteograms
The meso_meteogram.py script plots a single day and station's meteogram 
including soil temperature and moisture (if soil measurements were taken)
when run from the terminal as:
python meso_meteogram.py [4 letter station identifier] yymmdd

## Surface Plotting
For surface plotting there are two scripts:

*single_meso_surface.py is setup to create only one quick plot as 
specified in the file for trouble-shooting or plot manipulation.

*meso_surface.py is setup to create single-variable surface plots with wind 
barbs for a range of times at 5-minute intervals (the most common sampling
freqency of the stations) saved in varible-specific folders.  The plotted variable 
and time range are specified in the file.

## Configuration and Dependencies
The scripts assume that the mesonet data is stored in a 'raw_data/' folder in the
working directory in the original [Station]YYMM.txt file format.

These surface-plotting scripts also use a location.txt file in the working
directory downloaded from:
http://www.mesonet.ttu.edu/stationfile.htm

They are also currently setup to plot county boundaries which can be found in
mpl_toolkits/basemap/data in the basemap package or downloaded from an external
source.  The current configuration uses the county data in a local UScounties
directory.
